Project Overview

This project develops an AI-based explorer that learns to play a simple treasure-hunting game using reinforcement learning.
The game consists of a 1-dimensional grid where the explorer (o) starts at the leftmost position, 
and the treasure (T) is located at the rightmost position. The goal is for the explorer to learn how 
to reach the treasure as quickly as possible.

Objectives and Goals

	•	Train the explorer to maximize its reward by reaching the treasure.
	•	Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to enable the explorer to learn optimal movements.
	•	Analyze the explorer’s learning process and visualize its performance over training epochs.

 Potential Next Steps

	•	Extend the game to 2D or more complex environments with obstacles.
	•	Experiment with other RL algorithms (e.g., Deep Q-Networks).
	•	Introduce multi-agent settings where multiple explorers cooperate or compete to find the treasure.
